 <h2>Description</h2>
 <p>Brownie-like chocolate crinkle cookies are coated in confectioners' sugar. They're so good!</p>

 <h2>Ingredients</h2>
 <ul>
  <li>2 cup white sugar</li>
  <li>1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li> 
  <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
  <li>4 large eggs</li>  
  <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
  <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
  <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>½ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
 </ul>
 <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>Step</li>
   <p>Mix sugar, cocoa, and oil together in a medium bowl. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until combined. Stir in vanilla.</p>
   <li>Step</li>
   <p>Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in another bowl. Gradually stir dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until
   thoroughly mixed. Cover dough and refrigerator for at least 4 hours.
</p>
   <li>Step</li>
   <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
</p>
   <li>Step4</li>
   <p>Roll or scoop chilled dough into 1-inch balls. Coat each ball in confectioners' sugar and place 1 inch apart on the
   prepared cookie sheets.
</p>
   <li>Step</li>
   <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes. Let stand on the cookie sheet for a few minutes before transferring to
   wire racks to cool.
</p>
   <li>Step</li>
   <p>Repeat Steps 4 and 5 to make remaining batches.
</p>
  </ol>
<h3>Cookies Notes:</h3>
<p>I like to use a #50 scoop to help form the dough balls.</p>
<p>
If you don't want to make the cookies all at once, you can wrap any extra dough and freeze it for later.</p>
