# odin-recipes
A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

This was my first project in Odin foundation i.e Odin Recipes.
it was a very good experience. I got to learn a lot about HTML with the help of this project.
I gleaned some significant knowledge about Git also, Github as I submitted frequently, as a 
rule after a page was made and connected to index.html. I got to practice attempting to compose
great submit remarks, despite the fact that I feel there is a lot passed on to be wanted on that
part. I will proceed to develop this as I get more practice.

I additionally got to try all that I have learned in Foundations so far, similar to, boilerplates,
headings, sections, elective text, pictures, links, unordered and ordered lists, etc.

I am loving this journey and looking forward to more challenges ahead.
